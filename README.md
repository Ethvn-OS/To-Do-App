TO-DO EXERCISE

Using what we have learned in JavaScript and JQuery, we were tasked to create a To Do Web App.
We were provided with an API by our professor to use as our backend. The name of the To Do Web App
we created is called isMissed.

Here are the functionalities of the To Do App:
- Sign Up
- Sign In
- Get To Do Task (Active or Inactive)
- Add To Do Task
- Update To Do Task
- Change To Do Task Status
- Delete To Do Task

We used Tailwind CSS mainly for our frontend.
